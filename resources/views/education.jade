          h3.color-east-bay What Is A Credit Score?
          p.font-weight-light.m-0 A credit score is a number generated by a mathematical formula that is meant to predict creditworthiness. Credit scores range from 300-850. The higher your score is, the more likely you  are to get a loan. The lower your score is, the less likely you are to get a loan. If you have credit score and manage to get approved for credit, your interest rate will be much higher than someone who had a good credit score. So, having a high credit sore will save you many thousands of dollars.
